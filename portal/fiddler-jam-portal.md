# Fiddler Jam Portal

The [Fiddler Jam portal](https://jam.getfiddler.com) is the cloud space where logs submitted from you or other users can be viewed, organized, and analyzed. The Fiddler Jam portal is accessible only for users with active [Fiddler Jam portal subscriptions](#subscriptions). The Fiddler Jam portal provides various means to organize, access, and work with submitted logs. The portal allows [account owners]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) to set up different roles for the portal users with different access rights.


## Portal Users

The Fiddler Jam login accepts using custom credentials or Google authentication, but the portal will be accessible only for usernames/emails that are part of an active subscription. Depending on the user assigned role, the Fiddler Jam portal will provide a different level of accessibility and features as follows:

- Unregistered users won't be able to open the Fiddler Jam portal or load generated Fiddler Jam links. Note that no registration is needed to use the Fiddler Jam Chrome extension.
- Registered users with the **viewer** role can see only logs [added to a workspace]({%slug fj-workspaces%}#add-submitted-log-to-workspace). If a viewer opens a public link, a page will inform the user that the links need to be added to the account workspace.
- Registered users with the **agent** role can open public logs, create and manage workspaces, manage existing logs (manage, add and remove from workspaces).

## Using Submitted Logs

Logs can be added to workspaces, edited, shared, downloaded, or opened directly in [Fiddler Everywhere](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere/introduction) for in-depth analysis.
