# Welcome to Fiddler Jam!

Progress® Telerik® Fiddler Jam is a troubleshooting solution for end users, and for support and development engineering teams, which is designed to help them easily and securely communicate between each other, and quickly analyze and resolve issues.

The core components of Fiddler Jam are the Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension, which enables end users (or extension users) to capture HTTP or HTTPS network issues and submit logs in a secure environment, and the Fiddler Jam Portal, which stores these logs in the cloud for support and developer teams (or portal users) to locally replicate and further analyze those issues.

What's more, both Fiddler Jam components are fully integrated with the [Fiddler Everywhere web-debugging tool](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler-everywhere/introduction), which monitors, inspects, edits, and logs all HTTP and HTTPS traffic and provides a number of additional troubleshooting features.

## Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension

The Chrome Extension is aimed at end users and helps them troubleshoot website issues, but instead of manually attaching network logs to an email or a support ticket, they can directly share these logs through the Chrome extension. The submitted logs are automatically and safely stored in the Fiddler Jam Portal cloud and are available for the Fiddler Jam Portal users to inspect and help resolve those issues.

The Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension delivers a range of handy and end-user friendly features whose number and further development are not limited by the list in this section&mdash;the Fiddler team constantly invests efforts to improve the performance and add more value to the existing troubleshooting solution, and build on top of its available features.

The Chrome Extension solution can be installed, pinned, and used by everyone with Google Chrome and is also available in the Google Web Store. It does not require you to log in or register, nor does it call for any advanced knowledge in technology or previous debugging experience.

### Traffic Recording

The Fiddler Jam Chrome extension logs all HTTP, HTTPS and WebSocket traffic between the Chrome browser and the Internet, and enables users to capture network traffic from any application. [Read more about the recording logs with the Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension...]({% slug first_steps_extension %}#recording-a-log)

### Video and Screenshot Capturing

With the Chrome Extension, you can extend the log information by including a video recording of the expected browser page as well as screenshots for each user interaction with that page during the HTTP or WebSocket traffic recording.

### Browser Events and Data Capturing

The Chrome Extension captures browser events and, on demand, can record the local and session storage data as well as the developer console logs. [Read more about the advanced capturing options of the Chrome Extension...]({% slug fj-portal-logs %}#options-for-working-with-logs)

### Safe Online Log Submission in the Cloud

You can also quickly submit logs, recorded with the Chrome Extension, to the Fiddler Jam Portal cloud, where they can be saved, organized, analyzed, and shared with other collaborators.

### Sensitive Data Protection

The Fiddler Jam Chrome Extension comes with a default feature for masking sensitive information. [Read more about the available Chrome Extension masking options...]({% slug fj-capture-options %}#masking-cookies)

## Fiddler Jam Portal

The Fiddler Jam Portal is a cloud space that safely stores the network logs submitted by end users and enables support and developer teams to organize, inspect, and analyze them in a safe space. The further monitoring of the logs is enabled through the additional Fiddler Jam Portal debugging options, and can also be inspected with the Fiddler Everywhere web-debugging HTTP-proxy client due to the seamless integration between the two.

Fiddler Jam Portal delivers a range of handy and developer-friendly features whose number and further development are not limited by the list in this section&mdash;the Fiddler team constantly invests efforts to improve the performance and add more value to the existing troubleshooting solution, and build on top of its available features.

The Fiddler Jam Portal options are available for registered users with active seats only.

### User Roles and Access Rights

The Fiddler Jam Extensions and the Jam Portal provide a set of roles, each with specific access rights&mdash;for example, any portal user can access, edit, remove, and share logs submitted to the Jam portal, where the extension users can only create and share logs but don't have access to these logs in the Jam portal (unless they are also portal users).

### One-Click Integration with Fiddler Everywhere

For more complex scenarios where engineers need to run an in-depth investigation in a safe environment where the issue can be reproduced, tested, and shared, the Fiddler Jam Portal supports a seamless integration with the Fiddler Everywhere cross-platform web-debugging application. In this way, developers can save and download the captured traffic as an HTTP Archive format (HAR) file, or open a Fiddler Jam Portal log directly in Fiddler Everywhere.
