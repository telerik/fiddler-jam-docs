## What is the Fair Usage Policy?

Our product subscription includes **unlimited** access to the support service. In order to keep providing our industry-leading level of support, we have instituted a fair usage policy for our support services:
A support manager will review customer activities that exceed at least ten times the average amount of support requests to determine if such activities are deemed excessive.
