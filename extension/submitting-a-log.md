# Submitting a Log

Fiddler Jam logs can be submitted to the [Fiddler Jam portal]({%slug fj-portal%}) and shared with portal users via email or a direct link.

## Submit via Link

Collaboration is the main feature of Fiddler Jam. You can easily submit a log in a few steps:

1. [Record a log]({%slug fj-recording-logs%}).

2. From the [**Sharing options**]({%slug fj-link-options%}), set the access level for the recorded log (public or shared with specific people) and optionally [protect the log with a password]({%slug fj-link-options%}#password-protection-for-recorded-logs).

   The default drop-down selection is **Share with link**, which will create a public link. Click **Get Link** to submit the recorded Fiddler JAM log and generate a sharable link. The link points to the cloud space in the Jam portal that contains the submitted log. This URL is accessible only for Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with the appropriate access rights.

   Alternatively, you could select **Share with specific people**, which will create a link only for the portal users added explicitly via their account email. Click **Share Captured Logs** to submit the recorded Fiddler JAM log. This action sends an email notification to the specified recipients and then generates a shareable link. Simultaneously, the log is uploaded to the Fiddler Jam cloud space. This URL is accessible only for Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with the appropriate access rights.

3. Click **Copy Link** to store the unique URL to your machine's clipboard. Use this link to share the recorded logs with other Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users).

>tip Logs submitted to the Fiddler Jam portal **are private**. Only Fiddler Jam [portal users]({%slug fj-users%}#portal-users) with [the proper access rights]({%slug fj-link-options%}) are able to open a submitted log.


## Error Handling

Submitting a Fiddler Jam log is an operation that requires access to specific API endpoints and specific access levels for the user that accesses the Internet through the browser. Some users might experience an issue while starting the extension, capturing traffic, or submitting a generated Fiddler Jam log. In case you are facing a similar scenario, follow the following steps:

- Verify that you have active Internet access

- Verify that you have access to the following test endpoint: [https://fiddler-backend-production.s3.amazonaws.com/connectivity-test/check.html](https://fiddler-backend-production.s3.amazonaws.com/connectivity-test/check.html)

In case the issue resides elsewhere, proceed with collecting the error data from your browser.

- Open [chrome://extensions/?id=fnkjlegmkbicdodlheligomlfbdblpf](chrome://extensions/?id=fnkjlegmkbicdodlheligomlfbdblpf). When the Fiddler Jam extension is installed the link will open the Fiddler Jam extension details page. Scroll down and enable the **Collect errors** toggle.

- Submit a test session, then open chrome://extensions/ and send us a screenshot of the errors
